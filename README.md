# ML Strength - Health and Fitness Website Development Project 🏋️‍♀️🖥️

Welcome to this repository! It chronicles the planning, development, and launch of a fully-responsive, accessible, and user-friendly website for ML Strength, a Brisbane-based fitness company offering a range of fitness services. 

## 🚀 Project Overview:

### Part 1 - HTML Requirements and Site Design 🖼️:

The journey started with identifying the client's objectives for the website and the target audience. I then built the site structure and the `index.html` page. The key feature was designing a responsive page layout that could cater to a variety of devices and deliver an immersive user experience. This included a responsive hamburger menu, animated :hover states for menu items, and a comprehensive web form with various input types and error handling capabilities. The planning phase also incorporated wireframe diagrams for the website and the form.

### Part 2 - CSS Styling and Layout 🎨:

An external CSS file formed the backbone of the site's layout and aesthetics. The CSS model used a combination of Flex and Grid models with @media queries to deliver a truly responsive design. I styled text, standardized menus and footers, and applied form-specific CSS. To add a touch of interactivity and functionality, we also included pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements.

### Part 3 - Testing and Validation 🧪:

Once the design and development stages were completed, I embarked on a rigorous testing and debugging process to ensure I met all client requirements. I used the W3C Markup Validation Service to validate HTML and CSS. I also ensured cross-platform compatibility by testing the website across multiple browsers and devices. Compliance with WCAG 2.1 Level AA was confirmed through an online accessibility checker.

## 💻 Technical Stack

Built with HTML5 and CSS3 for structure and styling, we added a layer of interactivity and additional functionality using JavaScript. To ensure we met current standards and accessibility requirements, we also ensured compliance with WCAG 2.1 Level AA guidelines.

## 🏁 Final Remarks

This project stands as a testament to my ability to design and develop a responsive, accessible, and user-friendly website from scratch. The finished product successfully integrates all the client's requirements and delivers an intuitive user experience.
